# It Has Brain

This is a Foundry VTT module called "It Has Brain" that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to provide dynamic and engaging interactions in your games. It offers AI-based chat functionalities for non-player characters (NPCs) and game rule clarifications.

## Description

"It Has Brain" leverages AI to enrich role-playing games with dynamic NPC conversations and on-the-fly game rule clarifications. By using a simple chat command, players can engage in realistic conversations with NPCs or ask for help about game rules.

## Features

- **Interactive NPC Conversations**: Engage in dynamic and interactive chat conversations with NPCs using the '@NPC_NAME' syntax. AI-powered responses add depth and unpredictability to NPC interactions.
  
- **Game Rule Clarifications**: Stuck with a game rule while in the middle of the action? Just type your question in the chat starting with a '?', and get a quick AI-powered clarification.
  
- **NPC Background Generation**: Automatically generates character backgrounds for NPCs, giving depth to the world and aiding GMs in role-playing and plot development.
  
- **Conversation Toggling**: Control the noise level in your game by toggling NPC conversations on and off with a simple button click. 

- **Chat History and Journal Entries**: Document NPC interactions and store journal entries directly in the NPC's actor sheet for future reference.
